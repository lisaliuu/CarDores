## A functional ride-sharing web application for university students.

This project was created for the 2022 Vanderbilt Hackathon. It is built with Python Flask as the web framework and MongoDB as the database with Google authentication. CarDores is a web application that allows users to log in, post, find, and request to join rideshare within the college community. The motivation is to streamline the ride-sharing process, which currently exists as a large group chat.

#### Supported features:

- Login with a Google account
- Post a new ride with information including destination, time, number of seats, contact
- View all available rides
- Request a ride, sending an email to the poster to accept or decline the request
