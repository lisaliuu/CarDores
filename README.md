# CarDores

## A functional ride-sharing web application for university students.

This project was created for the 2022 Vanderbilt Hackathon. It is built with Python Flask as the web framework and MongoDB as the database with Google authentication. CarDores is a web application allows users to login, post, find, and request to join rideshare within the college community. The motivation is to streamline the process of ridesharing which currently exists in the form of a large group chat.
